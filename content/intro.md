You are trying to change the world with your business. So am I. 
See, I believe the world needs more creative ideas. Not more of what's already out there...that's just noise.

How do I do it?
I use the knowledge I gained from graphics design studies and experience that I have gathered in the past 4 years working for small private companies and clients. In addition to that, I spent a great amount of time constantly learning new creative skills using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom and a simple pencil(the best tool to get ideas flowing!) while the degree in psychology helps to understand and to attract the right audience.

I promise you a high standard service, efficient communication, and most importantly a QUALITY product. My clients always say that a "great COMMUNICATION" is one of my strongest skills and I believe it is a key to success. 
You can check out my [awesome work](#work) and if I seem to be the person right for the job, let me know.
